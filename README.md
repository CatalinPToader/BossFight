# BossFight
A Paper plugin that adds endgame boss fights.

This plugin was made in quite a bit of haste for deployment on a private SMP (survival multi-player) and as such most of the code is uncommented.
It suffers from a lot of terrible decisions and was left semi-abandoned due to the SMP dying and not receiving enough feedback for continuing development.
